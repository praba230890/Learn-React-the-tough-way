# Getting started with React:

I recommend to visit the [getting started page](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and spend a couple of hours there by clicking on links which makes sense to you or interest you and read through them to align your goal with the material.

Everyone wants to learn react for different purpose. Some might just want to compare it with other frameworks and see how it compares. Others might want to use it to build a web application for their side project and some might want to use it to build a web application for their company. So it's completely up to you to navigate through the docs based on your goals. 

But I would recommend to not skip the [guide to main (12 pages) concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html), since they are the fundamental building blocks of react.

## Lets get into the basics of React:

### Prerequisites for React:
 * **JavaScript (ES5, ES6) or Typescript **
 * Basics of HTML, CSS (could be learned along the way)
  
## Introduction 
### Basics: 
 * A modern frontend web application in todays world should be capable of doing a lot of things including the below, 
   * it needs to make REST API requests and process the received response
   * without refreshing the entire page needs to update a part of a page based on either user input or API response or some events or timers
   * should support accessibility, localization and internationalization 
   * should be responsive (support multiple screen sizes) 
   * [should load faster](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance/What_is_web_performance) (painting, repainting, updating dom) 
 * What React is capable of doing from the above list, and will the React applications satisfy the requirements of a modern web app? How much of it can be done by React itself. For what it requires other library or framework to be used along React?
 * What React doesn't do or when not to use React?
 * Learn the difference between front end libraries and frameworks, and find under which React falls into
### Intermediary:
 * [React Virtual DOM, Internals](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html)
 * Javascript libraries for making API calls
 * CSS frameworks that supports React out of the box
### Advanced:
 * [React design principles](https://reactjs.org/docs/design-principles.html)
 * Compare React with Angular, Vue and any other popular front end framework or libraries
